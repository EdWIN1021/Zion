- Base Color
	- Texture Sample
- Metallic [0,1]
	- A scalar value that defines whether a surface behaves like a metal or a non-metal (dielectric) in terms of light reflection.
- Specular [0,1]
	- A scalar value that controls the intensity of specular reflection on a non-metallic surface.
- Roughness [0,1]
	- A scalar value that defines how rough or smooth a surface is, determining the spread and intensity of specular highlights.
- Normal
	- **modify the surface normal direction to affect lighting and shadows**, simulating bumps and grooves **without increasing geometry complexity**
	- Texture Sample (NRM)
- Emissive Color
	- A color input in Unreal Materials that makes a surface appear self-illuminated
	- Texture Sample (EM)
