> decltype is a compile-time keywords in C++ (introduced in C ++ 11) that inspects the type of an expression without evaluating it.


```cpp
const int ci = 0, &cj = ci;

decltype (ci) x = 0;   // x has type const int
decltype (cj) y = x;   // y has type const int& and is bound to x
decltype (cj) z;       // z is a reference and must be initialized
```

```cpp
int i = 42, *p = &i, &r = i;
decltype (r + 0) b;              // b is an uninitialized int
```

if the expression is an lvalue decltype returns an lvalue reference to the type.

Since p can appear on the left-hand side of an assignement (*p = 50), it is an lvaue.

```cpp
decltype (*p) c;      // error: c is int& and must be initialized
```

When we apply decltype to a variable without any parentheses, we get the type of that variable.

If we wrap the variableâ€™ name in one or more sets of parentheses, the compiler will evaluate the operand as an expression

```cpp
decltype ((i)) d; // error:: d is int& and must be initialized
```
