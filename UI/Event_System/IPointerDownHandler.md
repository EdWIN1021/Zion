- The `IPointerDownHandler` interface is used in Unity to detect a press event from a mouse or touch on a UI element.

```cpp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.EventSystems; // Must import this namespace

public class ClickDetector : MonoBehaviour, IPointerDownHandler  // Implement the interface
{
    // This method is called when the pointer is pressed down on this object
    public void OnPointerDown(PointerEventData eventData)
    {
        Debug.Log("You pressed me!");
    }
}
```
