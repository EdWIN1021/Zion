- An Actor class refers to any entity that can be placed within a level, whether it's a camera, a static mesh, or the player's character.
- An actor can undergo transformation such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
- Actors serve as containers for specialized classes known as components that play various roles in controlling a movement, rendering and more.
