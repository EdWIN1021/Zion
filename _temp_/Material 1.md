### Base Color
- Texture Sample
### Metallic [0,1]
- A scalar value that defines whether a surface behaves like a metal or a non-metal (dielectric) in terms of light reflection.
### Specular [0,1]
- A scalar value that controls the intensity of specular reflection on a non-metallic surface.
### Roughness [0,1]
- A scalar value that defines how rough or smooth a surface is, determining the spread and intensity of specular highlights.
### Normal
- **Modify the surface normal direction to affect lighting and shadows**, simulating bumps and grooves **without increasing geometry complexity**
- Texture Sample (NRM)
### Emissive Color
- A color input in Unreal Materials that makes a surface appear self-illuminated
- Texture Sample (EM)
## ORM 
- ORM (Occlusion, Roughness, Metallic)
- Texture Sample
