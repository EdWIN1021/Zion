Engine’s constructor function creates Input before Window, and Window before Renderer; the Input system instance address created is passed (via the WindowConfig struct) to the Window system; the Window system instance address is passed (via the RendererConfig struct) to the Renderer.


Seven unique game code objects are created and added to your GameNearestPoint class:

1. Triangle, Disc, AABB, OBB, Capsule, LineSegment, “infinite” line (parametric line segment)
2. Each shape has its own game code class, which is a subclass of a game code base class TestShape.
    1. _For example, class TestShapeTriangle : public TestShape_
3. Each game object contains whatever math primitive shape info it needs (e.g. start & end points for line segment, three points for a triangle, center & radius for a disc, or an entire OBB2/AABB2/etc.).

```cpp
App* m_app; // Game?
```

```cpp
void App::Render() const
{
	g_engine->m_render->ClearScreen( BACKGROUND_COLOR );

	if ( m_game )
	{

		m_game->Render();

	}
}

```

```cpp
Renderer::BindTexture(nullptr)  ??
